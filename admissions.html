					<h2>Admissions Process</h2>
					<p>
						Serenity is a private therapeutic school, serving students from up
						to twenty-two metro-area public school districts. Currently, 100% of
						the referrals we receive are generated by public school districts
						that have determined that their district can no longer meet the
						needs of a specific student.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once Serenity receives a referral, it is reviewed by our Admissions
						Coordinator. Next, a screening meeting is scheduled with a school
						district representative, parent/guardian, other relevant team
						members (i.e. therapist, CASA volunteer, attorney, county
						caseworker), as well as up to three Serenity representatives.
						Following this meeting, Serenity’s admissions team will review the
						referral/screening information and determine if Serenity can provide
						a program that will produce successful outcomes for the student.
					</p>
					<p>
						If a decision is made to move forward with a Serenity placement, one
						of our Clinical Case Managers will schedule a Mental Health Intake
						with the student and their parent/guardian. The school district will
						be contacted after the Intake with information about a start date.
						Start dates will be set up to five school days following the Intake
						allowing time for an assessment and treatment plan to be written and
						for the classroom staff to prepare to welcome the new student.
					</p>
					<p>
						An IEP review will be scheduled at least six weeks into a student’s
						enrollment to allow the team to review and discuss the student’s
						transition into our program. At this time, discharge criteria for
						the student will be determined.
